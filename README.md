# OpenWebStudio

This project, forked from Kevin Schreiner's project https://github.com/kevinmschreiner/OpenWebStudio, was created to play around with
adding Code Mirror http://codemirror.net and Emmet https://emmet.io in the form of the Emmet for Code Mirror plugin
https://github.com/emmetio/codemirror to the OWS Admin interface.  I don't believe the full source for the original project is here, so I
will be adding files to complete this project.
